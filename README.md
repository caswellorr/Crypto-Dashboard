## Description 📖

The Cryptocurrency Dashboard web application allows a user to search a crypto coin (by its abbreviation) in the search bar and see a candlestick graph that displays the market price changes from the past 10 days. 

The user may also view a marquee of the top cryptocurrencies.

## Features 📝

This application uses two cryptocurrency APIs:

The API fetches data from Poloniex to be displayed on a candlestick graph.
